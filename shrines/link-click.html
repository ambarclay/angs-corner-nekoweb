            <p>
              Using superpowers to enter their clients' photos one by one, Cheng Xiaoshi and Lu
              Guang take their work seriously at Time Photo Studio, a small photography shop set in
              the backdrop of a modern metropolis. Each job can be full of danger, but nothing is
              more important than fulfilling every order, no matter the scale... or peril involved!

          Nothing sad ever happens in Link Click. Don't trust me? Go watch it and find out for
          yourself.
        </p>
        <p>Oh boy this show. oh man. whew.</p>
        <p>
          So, I first found out about Link Click from an artist that I follow on Instagram. She
          posted some fan art of it and of course because I'm me I had to go and immediately check
          it out. At the time there were only 5ish episodes of the first season out. I was a little
          wary to start watching it at first because it was only in Chinese and I was not at all
          used to hearing Chinese voice over, and I was just worried I wouldn't be able to get used
          to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, I got used to it; by the last episode that was out (the basketball one, iykyk) I was
          bawling my eyes out like a baby, and Link Click was cemented as one of my favorite shows
          of all time. Season 2 only further confirmed this feeling for me, and then the Bridon Arc
          just made be sad (but it was also very good too). And here I am a week after finishing the
          most recent season, not being able to stop thinking about it, what's new am I right?
        </p>
        <img src="/shrines/images/FilmMovie.gif" class="centerimg" />
        <p>
          Basically, the premise of the show is that our main characters, Lu Guang and Cheng
          Xiaoshi, have some cool powers. Lu Guang can look into a photo and see the events that
          happened 12 hours after the photo was taken, and Cheng Xiaoshi can dive into the photo,
          possess the one who took the photo, and actually change the past through this person.
        </p>
        <p>
          With these powers the two of them fulfill requests from people who come to the shop,
          whether it be to find out a secret recipe for noodles or to relay a message to an old
          friend. And of course, because they're messing with time, things are bound to get weird
          eventually.
        </p>
        <p>
          This show has ripped out my heart, stomped on it, and buried it six feet under the ground.
          I will never be able to emotionally recover from the end of Season 2, and I don't think
          the creators of the show want us to either. Pretty sure they just wanna set us up for a
          depression ending, but I will keep inhaling copium that somehow everyone gets a happy
          ending.
        </p>
        <h1>Spoilers Ahead!</h1>
        <p style="text-align: center">
          Seriously don't spoil yourself with my rant just go watch the show I promise you won't
          regret it.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the weird stuff I mentioned earlier? Just a little tiny thing: Lu Guang has been
          repeating years of his life in order to stop Cheng Xiaoshi from dying, breaking his own
          rule of not changing the past. According to Lu Guang, death is a node that cannot be
          changed, but still he struggles against this in order to save his friend. Absolutely
          heartbreaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can't even imagine being Lu Guang, seeing the most important person to you die over and
          over again and being powerless to stop it (despite literally having powers to travel in
          time).

          Link Click is so good that it has been forshadowing this plotline since the beginnig,
          specifically in the OP and ED songs (which have all made their way into my playlists, not
          to mention intoducing me to Fan Ka who is now one of my favorite artists. Seriously go
          check out his music other than the stuff from Link Click it's so good).

          Like, you've got to be kidding me right? They told us the whole plot right in the
          beginning of the OP but only now can we finally understand it? At least this is kinda
          forshadowing a happy ending (copium).

          I remember sitting there parsing through all of the song lyrics and what had happened in
          the most recent episodes and being like, oh god this is gonna get really sad really quick
          isn't it.

          This doesn't have anything to do with the story it's just how I feel after catching up
          with every episode of the show.

          It's just about the time to say this: LU GUANG IS IN LOVE WITH CHENG XIAOSHI!!!! IF YOU DO
          NOT BELIEVE THIS THEN YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED THE SHOW!!! LOOK AT THIS SHIT AND TELL ME THEY
          AREN'T IN LOVE:

          Ok I'm gonna be honest, when I started this show I had no idea that it was gonna be at all
          bl coded (source: watch the show). I was just like 'yo these guys are doing fun time
          superpower stuff this is interesting.' Ngl I did lowkey ship them in the beginning just
          cause they had good chemistry, but as Season 1 ended I was pretty convinced that it was
          actually just Chinese censorship ridden bl. Joe and I even had a debate about it and he
          wasn't convinced, he still just thought that they were just close friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then Season 2 happened. If you have seen season 2 there is absolutely no way you could
          come out of it thinking that those two are anything but in love with each other. Even Joe
          was convinced that at the very least Lu Guang was in love with Cheng Xiaoshi. I mean, I
          love my friends, but the only person I think I would witness their death countless times
          and endure a never ending 3 year time loop for would probably be Joe, who is in fact by
          partner who I am in love with.
        </p>
        <p>
          You <em>especially</em> cannot deny this ship if you've seen Bridon Arc. Bro half of one
          of the episodes was literally just a cute montage of them doing silly things together like
          every other romance anime to exist. Like you cannot tell me that they aren't supposed to
          be together. Somehow the bl always finds me (not complaining about that).
        </p>
        <p>
          There was even a MDZS reference in the first episode of Bridon Arc, MDZS being ONE OF THE
          MOST POPULAR BL's IN CHINA. Bruh, BiliBili even posts ship videos on their social media!!!
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center">These brothers are sworn, y'all. Ain't no doubt about it.</p>
        <img src="/shrines/images/FilmMovie.gif" class="centerimg" />
        <p>
          The artists/ social media team/ whoever is involved is putting thier everything into
          promoting this show too. The amount of official art that the team makes is crazy, not to
          mention tons of original songs between seasons (which yes, they are all bangers). Not just
          the amount, but the quality of everything is top notch too.
        </p>
        <p>
          I know I've talked about the story a whole lot, but the animation of the show just keeps
          getting better as the seasons go on. You can tell a lot of the animators want to flex
          their fight scene animating chops, but hey I love fighting so I've got no problem with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can tell that every aspect of this show has had a lot of thought and care put into it.
          They had an idea in the beginning and have been working hard to bring that idea into the
          world (and have been doing a top notch job of it too).
        </p>
        <p>
          I just love this show so much and think that everyone should watch it even if you're not
          into animation. We made Joe's mom watch it and even she loves it (even if the storyline/
          character names confuse her a bit lol). Whenever she comes over she asks to watch more
          episodes, which luckily we have Bridon Arc to watch with her now.
        </p>
        <p>
          The one thing I wish for is for there to be more Link Click merch available here in the US
          because ya'll know I would buy all of it in a heartbeat and make a real shrine on my
          bookshelf.
