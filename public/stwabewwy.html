                when i was a kid, iPods were all the rage. i had a silver iPod nano, then when i was in middle school upgraded to the iPod touch 4th
                gen. all of the music i had either came from the cd's that my parents had, music that my mom had downloaded from limewire (oof), and
                occasionally some albums and songs i bought myself using iTunes gift cards. if you wanna get an idea of the time period, the first
                album i ever bought with my own money was <em>the e.n.d.</em> by black eyed peas.

              but once i got a smartphone in high school, streaming music was the thing to do. not to mention there's no way i could fit all of my
              music on my iPhone storage. like everyone else at the time, i made myself a spotify account and started to build my library of liked
              songs and playlists, and my iPods faded into my memory.
            </p>
            <p>
              fast forward to 2024, i really wanted to start digitally detoxing from my phone and social media. i had heard of people 'decentralizing'
              their smartphones, basically getting rid of their smartphone in favor of a collection of dumb tech (think flip phones, mp3 players,
              watches, a digital camera, etc.), and decided that was the way i wanted to go. also being an avid fan of
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/dankpods" class="link">dankpods</a> on youtube and someone who loved their iPods growing up, i thought
              it would be the perfect time to pick up a new hobby: building and modding iPods.
            </p>
            <img src="images/gifs/ipodspin.gif" />
            <p>
              originally i wanted to be really ambitious and build a 5th gen iPod classic from scratch, but my knowledge (and wallet) decided that
              that wouldn't have been a very good idea. after watching multiple tutorials on youtube and trolling ebay listings, i decided to go with
              a pink iPod mini 1st generation with these mods: new battery and replace the hard drive with sd card storage.
            </p>
            <p>
              it took a lot of trial and error (and damaging the case a bit), but i was able to replace the battery and storage without completely
              messing everything up! now i own all of my music- i don't have to n data and streaming services, i can listen to literally anything
              without worrying if it's on spotify, and i can directly support musicians i like by buying their music! pretty good deal.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>but ang,</em> i hear you wondering, <em>don't artists make money when people stream their music?</em> well yes, but actually no.
              sure if you're a super popular musician with millions of fans you could make a good chunk of change, but your average indie band is
              probably making just a few bucks, and if they're a real small artist nothing at all.
            </p>
            <p class="spotify-article" style="text-align: center">
              <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/30/spotify-smaller-artists-wrapped-indie-musicians" class="link">
                $0.003 a stream. and only if you get more than 1,000 streams per year, otherwise spotify ain't paying you jack.</a
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              but see, if you have an mp3 player, supporting your favorite artists is as easy as buying their music! stinky spotify won't be stealing
              money from the bands i like any time soon.
            </p>
            <p>
              now's a good time to mention
              <a href="https://bandcamp.com/" class="link">bandcamp</a>, a super awesome website where you can discover new music and directly support
              the musicians you find. 80% of the money you spend goes directly to the artist, which is pretty rad compared to streaming sites. i've
              actually discovered a lot of cool music through bandcamp, and a bunch of musicians local to me have pages which make it really easy to
              support them.

            <p>
              quick little super niche aside- old iPods have a super good DAC (digital to analog converter), which means your music will sound really
              good if you have the right headphones. you can even get super cool and install software that lets you play FLAC files and get nice iems
              and then your music sounds really REALLY good, but tbh the audiophile stuff kinda goes right over my head. youtubers like dankpods can
              explain it a lot better than i can.
            </p>
            <p>
              anyway! the point i wanted to make here is BUY AND OWN YOUR MUSIC WHILE SUPPORTING ARTISTS DIRECTLY! you will have your music forever,
              and musicians won't have to rely on shoddy income from streaming services. it's just a win-win situation.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center"><em>why'd you name it stwabewwy???</em></p>
            <p>
              ok so i have an inside joke with my family where we say <em>oh bwudder</em> all the time, and i didn't wanna just leave the default name
              on my iPod or have it be 'ang's iPod' or something like that, so i was trying to think of pink things to name it and jokingly said
              <em>stwabewwy</em>, but then my dad was like 'nope thats what you have to call the iPod you can't change it now'... so yeah, it was a
              joke that just kinda stuck.
            </p>
