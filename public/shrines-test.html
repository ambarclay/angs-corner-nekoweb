  <h3>have you ever wondered what ang is obsessed with?</h3>
  <p>
    yeah so this page is gonna serve as the main hub to collect all of my shrines. these pages are about literally anything that i am currently
    obsessed with and cannot stop thinking about. mostly probably gonna be media like anime, manga, books, and videogames. sometimes maybe ships or
    characters.

    you ever stay up until 4am researching and obsessing about a piece of media or a character or an idea or literally anything? that is me all of the
    time, and it's almost always soemthing stupid that i will forget about in a couple weeks anyway. i thought that making these shrine pages would be
    a healthier outlet for my hyperfixations and hopefully help me sleep at night instead of going on deep dives.
