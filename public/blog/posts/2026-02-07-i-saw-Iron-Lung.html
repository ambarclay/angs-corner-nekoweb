        <p><i>There will be mild spoilers for Iron Lung in this post! Be warned!</i></p>

        <p>
          This past week I got to go to my local theater to see Markiplier's debut movie, Iron Lung. Going in to watching it I was not familiar with
          the game at all. In fact, when the game came out 4 years ago I tried to watch Markiplier and Jacksepticeye's let's plays of it and just
          couldn't get into it at all. I actually tried to watch Mark's let's play again after I got home from the movie, and STILL couldn't get into
          it. I've been a big fan of Markiplier since his FNAF videos blew up in 2014 (I was in high school, god I feel old just saying that), so even
          if I wasn't expecting the movie to be that good, I wanted to go, watch the movie, and support him.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was expecting the movie to be better than other movies I knew that YouTubers made (see Smiley, Not Cool, the Smosh movie, the Fred movie,
          etc.) just because of the fact that it was a passion project done independently by Mark and a small team of people, but honestly my
          expectations were still low because of how bad those other YouTuber movies were. Not that I didn't think Mark could make something good, but
          writing, directing, and staring in your own movie? That felt pretty ambitious for a YouTube let's player.
        </p>

        <p>Iron Lung was one of my favorite horror movies I've seen in a long time.</p>

        <p>
          And I swear I'm not just saying that because I'm a fan of Mark, at least I don't think I am. My favorite kind of horror movies are slow
          burns with little to no jump scares, with the scariest parts being the building sense anxiety and dread and the short glimpses of creatures
          out of the corner of your eye. I swear that horror movies now are mostly just slashers or jumpscare-fests, so the last one that really gave
          me that “ew gross” anxiety feeling was Hereditary. And Iron Lung is the next to be added to that list. I swear that I was the ideal viewer
          of this movie. This is my movie! It was made for me!
        </p>

        <p>
          (Ok I didn't know where else to add this in, but do you remember that movie Buried where it was nothing but Ryan Reynolds trapped in a box
          the whole time? I hated that movie when I saw it. Iron Lung is everything that movie wanted to be and more. Like 10,000 times better in my
          opinion.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's get into the meat and potatoes of this film. For most of the run time, you are trapped with the convict Simon, played by Markiplier,
          in a submarine called the Iron Lung, stuck at the bottom of an ocean of blood. Because of this, a lot of the movie relies on Mark's acting.
          I was really worried that I wouldn't be able to separate Markiplier the person from Simon the character while watching, but after around the
          first 20 minutes I was fully bought in. Mark's performance was stellar, and I really thought he shines the most in the moments where Simon
          was crashing out (which happens kinda often, I don't blame him.) Hearing Elsie Lovelock, Troy Baker, and Mick Lauer's voice performances was
          a real treat, and of course they all did amazing too.
        </p>

        <p>
          This movie is a slow burn, a <i>really</i> slow burn, and it takes it's time to make you feel like you're trapped in this submarine with
          Simon. Some people will think it's boring that you're just watching Simon go about his little tasks, but I thought it was the perfect built
          up for when shit hits the fan later in the movie. If there was only a little set up before Simon loses it and smashes the speaker, I don't
          think that it would have as much impact as it did. Up to that point we've been stuck in here with Simon, and we really feel the dread the
          moment everything starts to go wrong. I think that we need more movies like this, willing to take their time and have a slow setup with no
          exposition dumps or fast paced action. In the era of short form content and widespread brainrot, media like this just feels so rare.
        </p>

        <p>
          Like I said, I didn't know anything about the lore of the game going in, and I'm really glad I went in blind. Everything I needed to know
          was explained over the course of the film, hints dropping through dialogue between Simon and whoever he was talking to over the submarines
          speaker at the moment, and just a bit of exposition given at the start of the film to get us up to speed. I love that nothing was given to
          us is huge monologues or info-dumps, this movie wanted you to be absorbed and actually pay attention. From what I know, Mark added some plot
          points to the movie that were not present in the game, giving a little more context to Simon and the universe the story takes place in. I
          think the whole eldritch/ cosmic horror thing was his addition too.
        </p>

        <p>
          Real quick lemme talk about the horror elements. No jump scares (FINALLY), just hallucinations and insanity. You see something out of the
          corner of your eye. You see an x-ray of the creature outside of the sub. You see the oxygen slowly deplete and the blood slowly start to
          seep in through the cracks in the construction of the submarine. You hear voices. You, along with Simon, slowly lose you mind being trapped
          alone at the bottom of an ocean. I'm so glad to see a horror movie that doesn't just rely on cheap scares and takes it's time to let the
          horror seep into your bones, because it makes the payoff in the last part of the movie so so worth it.
        </p>

        <p>
          The cinematography of this film was probably my favorite part about the whole thing. It never felt boring or same-y despite us being in the
          same small space the whole time. The shots with the probe lens of Simon turning the dials and driving the sub? Brilliant. The slow motion
          shot of the blood crashing into the sub and past Simons face? Cool as hell. Phillip Roy, who did the cinematography, must be a genius
          because everything was so meticulously crafted and looked so so good. This is one aspect where I don't really have the words to describe
          just how good it was, just that it was really really really really good.
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course I have to mention the music and sound design, too. One reason I'm glad we saw it in theaters: the moments where the creature was
          swimming around the submarine, in the theater you could actually hear and feel it moving around you. The music, or rather the ambiance,
          added another layer to the creeping sense of dread that the film did such a good job at building up. Every piece of this movie fit together
          like a puzzle, each one adding to the experience, and no one piece overshining or detracting from the others.
        </p>

        <p>
          I do want to mention the couple of issues I had with the movie, because as much as I loved it, it wasn't perfect. At some points it was very
          difficult for me to understand what was being said by the people talking on the speaker, and sometimes I was really wishing I had subtitles.
          I know that there were times that we weren't meant to understand, but there were moments where I would hear the speaker say something
          unintelligible, but then Simon would respond to it as if it was said clear as day. The end of the movie too had a bit of this problem, the
          overlapping voices of the eldritch horror being speaking while Ava is trying to get Simon to retrieve the data and the voice recording is
          playing explaining why the other submarine found, my brain just checked out because I just couldn't pick up what was going on. I think the
          movie was trying to make the viewers feel just as disoriented as Simon was, but I missed plot points like the ocean was made up of human
          blood. The second problem: I think some of the shots were a little too dark. And again, I know there was times where it was supposed to be
          dark, but there were other times where I felt as if I should have been able to see what was going on but I just couldn't. Honestly, both of
          these problems were probably because this movie was edited by a just a few people, including Mark, on their backlit computers, with
          headphones. The movie wasn't supposed to have a wide cinema release, so it probably wasn't optimized to be viewed in a theater, but rather
          at home, on your computer or TV, with headphones or a small sound system. Once this movie comes out for home viewing I'll be able to see how
          true this guess is.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite the couple of issues, you could tell that every second of this movie was oozing with love and care for both the game it was based on
          and the craft of film making, and I think that alone overshadows the issues for me. Just the fact that an independently created and released
          movie could do this well in the box office, with no marketing other than Mark himself on his channel and word of mouth through the fandom,
          and also be this good, gives me hope for the future of cinema. Mark and the whole team obviously put so much effort into every part of the
          film, and you could really tell.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, for a TLDR: Iron Lung was an amazing slow burn, dread inducing movie, where every second was crafted with love and care by a very
          talented team of people, and I loved it.
        </p>

        <p>
          I was thinking about this movie the whole way home from the theater and into the next morning, it effected me that much. I don't know if it
          was just because I had lower expectations going in or cause I'm a fan of Markiplier, but I was genuinely so impressed. If you've watched
          Charlie's (MoistCr1TiKal's) videos about Iron Lung, he echos a lot of the same opinions I had. And seriously, I hope this movie really
          starts to shake up the current state of Hollywood and cinema. I want more slow burn horror, I want more independent movies where the writer/
          director retains full creative control, I want more people to make things because they want to instead of being beholden to what the
          corporations want, I want to see movies from people who love the craft. I will 100% be buying any DVD or Blu-ray of Iron Lung that comes
          out, not just to further support Mark, but also to show the big wigs in Hollywood that THIS is the shit we want to see.
        </p>

        <p>
          Anyway, go see Iron Lung if it's still in a theater near you. And if it's not, watch it when it comes to streaming or DVD. Cause if you're a
          slow burn horror fan like me, you will not regret it.
