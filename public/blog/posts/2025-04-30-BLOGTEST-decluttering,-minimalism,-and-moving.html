          Tomorrow, May 1st, marks exactly 2 months left in the house Joe and I are renting. We've been in this place for the last 4 years, so you
          would think that moving out would be difficult and emotional, but so far it's been the complete opposite for me. I'm excited to go through
          our things, pack up, and move out. Maybe it's because we still have a couple months here, but still I'm surprised I'm not more emotional
          about it (I do tend to cry about everything lol.)
        </p>

          <i>So Ang, where are you guys moving to?</i> Yeah... we're moving back in with my parents. It's only temporary while we look for a house to
          buy though! We've got a big trip planned in October and didn't want to buy anything before that, and our lease is up the 1st of July, so we
          needed somewhere to go in the mean time. And no, the bus isn't ready so we can't live in that yet haha.

          Joe and I have been interested in minimalism for a while, both digital and physical. I really like watching
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SamuraiMatcha" class="link">Samurai Matcha</a> on YouTube, and he has really inspired me to try and live a
          more minimal life with only the things I need. My biggest probalem is that I am a very nostalgic and sentimental person, so I find it really
          difficult to get rid of basically anything. But now, because we are moving into my tiny ass childhood room with basically no extra space,
          and cause any extra stuff means we need to pay more money for a bigger storage unit, I'm pretty much being forced to get rid of anything
          that I don't really need.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was really expecting myself to get really emotional while decluttering all of our stuff (notice the running theme), but it's actually felt
          like a huge weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. At this point we've only gone through a few closets and bookshelves, but I have had
          so much stuff that I was keeping because I thought I needed to for one reason or another. To finally realize that it's okay to not have a
          bunch of notebooks 'just in case', it's okay to get rid of the hundreds of pencils and pens I don't use, it's okay to only have a few
          candles, it's okay to get rid of gifts I don't like or don't use... it's so freeing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Focusing on the candles for a second, I probably had over 50 candles tucked away on a shelf in the closet. There were so many that half the
          time I went to light one, I got decision paralysis because of the amount of options. Should I go for snickerdoodle or Merry Cookie or sugar
          cookie or peppermint sugar cookie or... you get the idea. I decided to keep one candle from each 'category' of scent, so now it's easy to
          pick out the one I want. Do I want the coffee candle, the fruity one, the baked goods one, or the balsam one? It's so simple.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm really excited to do what I did with the candles with the rest of our things. Making decisions gives me so much anxiety, so decreasing
          the amount of options for myself both keeps my space clean and free of clutter, and also gives me one less trigger for my anxiety.

          Even though I'm looking forward to being minimal for this next 1/2 - full year, I don't think we could ever be 'true' minimalists. As you
          can probably tell by how my website looks, I love collecting things. I have a decent sized camera collection that you would have to pry from
          my cold, dead fingers, as well as all of our books which we both love and don't want to get rid of. And I think that's okay.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a lot of the junk we've gone through and got rid of so far, it was just things we were keeping unconsiously because we thought we
          needed to or because 'we'll use it later' and never did. Our collections, though, are intentional. I know every camera I have, what film
          they use, what manufacturer made them, what year they're from, and have been working my way through testing them. Same thing with the books,
          we've gotten rid of the ones we don't like/ won't read, and what's left over is a collection of all of our favorite stories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joe and I have started calling this way of thinking <i>intentionalism</i> rather than minimalism. I have no idea if that's something that
          exists already, but how we see it is that we want everything we own to have a purpose. Each thing should have it's place in the house, and
          once those things do not have a purpose for us anymore then we give it away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doing a huge move and declutter like we're doing is the perfect excuse for us to fully implement this <i>intentionalist</i> way of thinking.
          I know that it'll be fairly easy to maintain this while living with my parents, but I'm hoping that once we move into a bigger space again
          that we can continue being intentional with the things we buy.
