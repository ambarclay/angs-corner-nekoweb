        <p>Well friends, it's been a little bit since I've updated my website.</p>

        <p>Here's a few life events that have happened since I've been here:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Made some YouTube videos</li>
          <li>Quit my full time job</li>
          <li>Went to Japan for a month</li>
          <li>Got engaged :D</li>
          <li>Started going back to college full time</li>
          <li>Bought a house</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So yeah, quite a few big life events all packed into a short span of time.</p>

        <p>
          Initially, I made this website as fun practice for my recently learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript coding skills, intending for it to be a fun
          place for me to share some of the things I enjoyed and occasionally update when I had new, fun things (like my cameras and progress on my VW
          bus). My little corner of the internet to share with strangers, without the need for likes or feeds or generated content. But, as what
          usually happnes with my projects, when I was “done” with the website after I made my YouTube video about it, it kinda fell by the wayside
          while I worked on other things and focused more on school. I tend to be the kind of person to really obsess over one thing for a period of
          time, but then once I move on I'm onto the next obsession and don't really think about the things I was doing before.
        </p>

        <p>
          It didn't help that I actually had no fun updates for any of my pages. No progress on the VW bus (waiting to get parts, my dad needing to
          focus on work, remodeling a bathroom, and fixing a tractor), no new cameras tested (film is expensive and I barely leave the house), and not
          really anything else interesting happened for a while. But then, everything hit at once. And here I am, coming back to tell you all the fun
          new things!
        </p>

        <p>
          (Actually, I didn't really realize just <i>how</i> long I was gone until I got a comment on my YouTube video about this site saying how my
          site was "dead" and just a set piece for the video, oof.)

          I spent a whole month in Japan, and while we were there my wonderful boyfriend proposed to me on our 10 year anniversary! We spent time in
          Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Kanazawa, and Nagano, and made little day trips to other towns when we could. My favorite thing we did was go to Nara
          deer park and feed the deer, they were all so cute! Also I spent waaaaaaayyyyyy too much money on the claw machines. I get why people get
          addicted to them now. But at least I got a big Mimikyu plushie out of it!

          I'm also in the middle of switching careers, going back to school for my associates in Web Design and Development. I had such a good time
          learning how to make this site (and learning so much more about web dev in the process) that now I want to make it my job. It's really
          exciting to finally be doing something that I don't hate, but it's also kinda a scary time to be switching from a teaching related job over
          to tech. I have no idea how AI is going to shape my new chosen field, but all I can do is learn and hope that everything will work out.
        </p>

        <p>
          Aaaaaand finally, for the biggest thing, my fiance and I bought a house! We close on it in just about a month, so we're neck deep in
          paperwork and finances and moving costs and paint colors and everything else that goes into buying a house.
        </p>

        <p>
          But yeah, here I am, back from the dead. I want to be more active on here, but I also won't make any promises. This website is my baby, and
          I've put so much work into it, so I absolutely won't abandon it, but also my life isn't very interesting so I don't have much to talk about
          haha. I do update my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@angieblah245" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> more often than I do this website,
          so if you wanna keep up with me thats the place to be (even if those updates are only once a month or less.)
        </p>

        <p>
          Thanks for reading and sticking with my not-updated-in-a-while site. Maybe I'll finally get around to making a page for my photography O.o
