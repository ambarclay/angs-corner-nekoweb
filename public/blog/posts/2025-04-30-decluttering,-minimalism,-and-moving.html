                Tomorrow, May 1st, marks exactly 2 months left in the house Joe and I are renting. We've been in this place for the last 4 years, so
                you would think that moving out would be difficult and emotional, but so far it's been the complete opposite for me. I'm excited to go
                through our things, pack up, and move out. Maybe it's because we still have a couple months here, but still I'm surprised I'm not more
                emotional about it (I do tend to cry about everything lol.)
              </p>
              <p>
                <i>So Ang, where are you guys moving to?</i> Yeah... we're moving back in with my parents. It's only temporary while we look for a
                house to buy though! We've got a big trip planned in October and didn't want to buy anything before that, and our lease is up the 1st
                of July, so we needed somewhere to go in the mean time. And no, the bus isn't ready so we can't live in that yet haha.

                Joe and I have been interested in minimalism for a while, both digital and physical. I really like watching
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SamuraiMatcha" class="link">Samurai Matcha</a> on YouTube, and he has really inspired me to try and
                live a more minimal life with only the things I need. My biggest probalem is that I am a very nostalgic and sentimental person, so I
                find it really difficult to get rid of basically anything. But now, because we are moving into my tiny ass childhood room with
                basically no extra space, and cause any extra stuff means we need to pay more money for a bigger storage unit, I'm pretty much being
                forced to get rid of anything that I don't really need.
              </p>
              <p>
                I was really expecting myself to get really emotional while decluttering all of our stuff (notice the running theme), but it's
                actually felt like a huge weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. At this point we've only gone through a few closets and
                bookshelves, but I have had so much stuff that I was keeping because I thought I needed to for one reason or another. To finally
                realize that it's okay to not have a bunch of notebooks 'just in case', it's okay to get rid of the hundreds of pencils and pens I
                don't use, it's okay to only have a few candles, it's okay to get rid of gifts I don't like or don't use... it's so freeing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Focusing on the candles for a second, I probably had over 50 candles tucked away on a shelf in the closet. There were so many that
                half the time I went to light one, I got decision paralysis because of the amount of options. Should I go for snickerdoodle or Merry
                Cookie or sugar cookie or peppermint sugar cookie or... you get the idea. I decided to keep one candle from each 'category' of scent,
                so now it's easy to pick out the one I want. Do I want the coffee candle, the fruity one, the baked goods one, or the balsam one? It's
                so simple.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm really excited to do what I did with the candles with the rest of our things. Making decisions gives me so much anxiety, so
                decreasing the amount of options for myself both keeps my space clean and free of clutter, and also gives me one less trigger for my
                anxiety.
              </p>

              <p>
                Even though I'm looking forward to being minimal for this next 1/2 - full year, I don't think we could ever be 'true' minimalists. As
                you can probably tell by how my website looks, I love collecting things. I have a decent sized camera collection that you would have
                to pry from my cold, dead fingers, as well as all of our books which we both love and don't want to get rid of. And I think that's
                okay.
              </p>
              <p>
                With a lot of the junk we've gone through and got rid of so far, it was just things we were keeping unconsiously because we thought we
                needed to or because 'we'll use it later' and never did. Our collections, though, are intentional. I know every camera I have, what
                film they use, what manufacturer made them, what year they're from, and have been working my way through testing them. Same thing with
                the books, we've gotten rid of the ones we don't like/ won't read, and what's left over is a collection of all of our favorite
                stories.
              </p>
              <p>
                Joe and I have started calling this way of thinking <i>intentionalism</i> rather than minimalism. I have no idea if that's something
                that exists already, but how we see it is that we want everything we own to have a purpose. Each thing should have it's place in the
                house, and once those things do not have a purpose for us anymore then we give it away.
              </p>
              <p>
                Doing a huge move and declutter like we're doing is the perfect excuse for us to fully implement this <i>intentionalist</i> way of
                thinking. I know that it'll be fairly easy to maintain this while living with my parents, but I'm hoping that once we move into a
                bigger space again that we can continue being intentional with the things we buy.
