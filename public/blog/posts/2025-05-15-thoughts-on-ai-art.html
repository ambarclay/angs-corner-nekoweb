        <p>tldr: i despise ai art with a burning passion.</p>
        <p>
          right now the city i live near is having its annual festival. it's always super fun, there's rides, games, greasy food, live music, and it's
          in the park where tons of trees are blossoming and flowers are blooming. overall it's a super fun time and i try to go every year. my
          favorite part of the festival though is walking thorugh all of the different local vendors to see all of the cool crafts, art, and food they
          have. i even got myself a cool tie dye bandana this year! but this post isn't about those people who obviously put a lot of time and effort
          into their craft.
        </p>
        <p>
          of course there's always the people just reselling things they bought from aliexpress or whatever, that always sucks to see. it makes it
          difficult to find products artists actually made, especially if you're under the assumption that everything is handmade. however, the amount
          of ai slop i noticed among the vendors this year was arocious. ai art prints, on t shirts, on peoples stall banners. hell, there was even
          one stall selling <i>ai art laser engraved on wood!!!</i> like you went through the trouble to laser engrave it just to use ai slop? wtf. it
          felt like i had to scrutinize every artists work just to make sure it wasnt ai.
        </p>
        <p>
          when i go to a local arts and crafts show, i'm expecting that the people there are selling things that they made by hand, not just peddling
          shitty stolen computer generated garbage at me. the worst thing is is that so many people can't spot ai art, so they buy it thinking that
          the vendor actually spent time and effort creating it, when in reality they're just looking to make a quick buck.
        </p>

          i was getting genuinely annoyed at the amount of ai i was seeing, and i think Joe was getting annoyed at me pointing out every single ai
          thing i noticed. but like, selling ai art night next to <i>real artists</i> felt like such a slap in the face to those people who put time
          and effort into learning their craft. the more i thought about it the angier i got!!!
        </p>
        <p>
          anyways, i will never condone the use of ai in anything, <i>especially</i> in creative projects. all we can do is call out those people who
          use ai, and keep creating things with our own abilities.
