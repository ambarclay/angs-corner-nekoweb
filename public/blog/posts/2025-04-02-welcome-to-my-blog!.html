          heyo, welcome to my super cool blog! i just wanted to write a little something to get this blog started out, so this post is mostly gonna be
          me rambling about my website.
        </p>
        <p>
          so the idea for this website had been in the back of my mind ever since i started to learn about web design and development around 2 years
          ago. i had the super cool idea to make a website that had 2 themes: one that was just like a normal/ professional looking website, then you
          could click a button and it would change into a fun, windows 98 style theme. now, i know this website isn't exactly that, but i'd still say
          that it came out pretty cool.
        </p>
        <p>
          i've been learning html and css for around 4ish years on and off, but really began to get serious about it around a year ago when i decided
          to learn javascript too. i took an online web development course and it really reignighted my passion for coding and design, so much so that
          i'm actually gonna go back to school to learn it and change my whole career.
        </p>
        <p>
          originally i just started this site with the pink theme, but after looking at so many other neocities pages i thought the pink theme just
          looked too basic and boring and i really wanted to change everything, but also didn't wanna get rid of all the work i had already done. so i
          ended up coding this really convoluted theme switcher that i will definitely have to change at some point to make a lot better, but that is
          a problem for future ang.
        </p>
        <p>
          recently i've been trying to give up all of my social media in favor of doing more learning/ creative activities, so i hope that i'll be
          able to use this website instead of doomscrolling on reddit and instagram all of the time. i'm taking a class on python right now and really
          trying my best to not procrastinate with it (but now i'm procrastinating that by working on this oof).
        </p>
        <p>
          anyway, thats about all i wanted to say for this intro post. keep an eye out over here cause i'll be posting more about projects i'm working
          on, things going on in my life, and hopefully some of my creative writing too! see ya later
