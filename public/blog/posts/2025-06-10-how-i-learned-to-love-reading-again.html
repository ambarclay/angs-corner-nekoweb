          So recently I've been getting recommended tons of videos like “Why Everyone Stopped Reading” or “Why No One Can Read Anymore” or “is tiktok
          ruining reading?” And yeah, as someone who has spend the last 4 years working with high school kids, most of them really don't read anymore
          (and aren't getting assigned to read books like I was back in school, but thats a different topic for a different day). Some of these videos
          attribute this decline in literacy to just the kids, but it’s not just them. People my age and older aren’t reading anymore either! And yes,
          for a long time this included me.
        </p>

        <h3>Why Did I Stop?</h3>

        <p>
          I remember when I was younger my mom and dad would read books often. They would read to me at night, my favorite was Captain Underpants, and
          we would go to the local library every week to pick out new books. My mom was the one who introduced me to Stephen King and my love of
          horror too. And while they still read very sparsely, most of the time my mom is just on her phone scrolling TikTok and my dad is on his iPad
          watching YouTube.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ya know, I can critique other people all I like, but up until a few years ago I was the exact same way. From probably my Junior year of high
          school until the year after I graduated college I think I read one book, maybe two if I'm being generous. Up until then I was such an avid
          reader, but there was a catch. I was always classified as an advanced reader at school, and I started reading Stephen King books when I was
          in 6th grade. The first one I read was Christine, suggested by my mom, and hoo boy I probably should not have been reading that at 11 years
          old. But my point being, it felt like everyone was expecting me to read “adult” books just because I could, and I missed out on reading a
          lot of YA series that my peers were reading like Harry Potter and Percy Jackson. Why read books that were “below” my level when I could be
          reading more difficult books to challenge myself and prove to everyone around me how smart I was?
        </p>

        <p>
          There was this one series of books I started when I was in Elementary School (<i>The Secret Series</i> by Pseudonymous Bosch), and new books
          in the series were still coming out by the time I started high school. I was still reading it at home, and even though I loved it so much
          and the first books in the series are still some of my favorites, I never finished the series because I thought I shouldn't be reading
          “easy” books that were “below” my reading level. This is what began my downward spiral that led to me not picking up a book for 6 years. I
          felt like if I wasn't reading difficult books then I was just wasting my time. Why read when I could be spending my time on homework or
          college applications or practicing my clarinet?
        </p>

        <p>
          Sure, during study hall my friends and I would read Creepypastas and stories on r/nosleep, and on long car rides I would listen to people
          read those stories, but that didn't count as reading, right?
        </p>

        <h3>The Thing That Made Me Love Reading Again</h3>

        <p>
          Fast forward to the end of 2020, the only book I had bothered to pick up and finish since high school was Misery (which is a great book and
          you should read it if you like horror). Covid was in full swing, I had just graduated college, and I was unemployed and depressed, doing
          nothing but scrolling through Twitter and Reddit and watching YouTube videos until 4 in the morning. I kept getting recommended posts from
          r/ShitpostCrusaders and had no idea what they were about, and saw a few people on my Twitter talking about something called Jojo's Bizarre
          Adventure. At that point I wasn't completely new to anime, as a kid I watched a ton of Pokemon and Yu Gi Oh, and in high school I watched
          Death Note and a little bit of the first season of Attack on Titan when that was the cool new thing. Because I was bored and had no job and
          nothing better to do, I thought, why not check out what this Jojo thing is all about.
        </p>

        <p>oh shit. i think i'm a weeb now...</p>

        <p>
          When we started Jojo's Bizarre Adventure Golden Wind was airing, so we watched all of the previous parts just in time to watch the second
          half of the season live. It was probably because this was the first exciting and fun thing in my life since I graduated college, but I fell
          in love with this stupid show. Now instead of staying up until 4am watching YouTube, I was up until 4am looking at fanart of Johnathan and
          Dio and Jotaro and the Stardust Crusaders gang and Josuke and...
        </p>

        <p>
          Oh, what is this? You're telling me that it's not just a show, but there's something called a manga? And theres 3 more parts that I can
          read? But I can't read Part 6 yet because I'm not done with Part 5... Part 7 has nothing to do with the last 6 parts? I can start there?
          Okay, lets do it!
        </p>

        <p>*2 days later* “oh no…. i need more of this”</p>

        <p>
          Yes, dear friends, becoming obsessed with anime and reading the Steel Ball Run manga is what made me love reading again. After that I began
          to pick up Tokyo Ghoul and some of Junji Ito's works because I love horror, I found Webtoons and web comics through anime fanart accounts I
          followed on Instagram, then learned about Danmei and Light Novels in a similar way. And now, all those years later, I have 4 bookshelves
          full of things that I've <i>actually</i> read.
        </p>

        <h3>Everything Counts As Reading</h3>

        <p>
          One of the biggest things I had to learn was to not care about what I “should” be reading or what other people expect me to read, and to
          just read things that made me happy. For so long I was only choosing things to read based on the fact that I was smart and needed to read
          “advanced” books, and that I was the creepy girl who liked creepy things so I can only read the scariest books I can find. I was so burnt
          out of reading the same things, but I felt like I would be wasting my time by reading anything else. When I got over other peoples
          expectations of what I should be reading, it opened up a whole new world of stuff for me.
        </p>

        <p>“Oh Ang, you know comics don't count as actual reading right-” Nope, shut up.</p>

        <p>
          Yes, reading comics count as reading, and I will fight anyone about this. You are reading words written on a page- its literally reading.
          Not to mention the art is amazing - you're telling me that just cause there's art on the page too that it doesn't count? Get real.
        </p>

        <p>
          Light novels count as reading, web novels count as reading, SMUT IS READING, FANFIC IS READING, CREEPYPASTA IS READING, SHORT STORIES ARE
          READING!!! IT ALL COUNTS!!! If you like these things, then keep reading them! Just because some weirdos with a superiority complex tell you
          that “um actually- it's not real reading” doesn't invalidate you, your preferences, or the fact that you are literally READING WORDS ON A
          PAGE OR SCREEN. And I know it's controversial, but yes, audiobooks also count as reading. Whatever it takes to get you interested in a book
          or short story or comic or fanfic, you should do it.
        </p>

            >It might sound simple, but finding the things I liked to read and not giving a shit about what other people thought about the things I
            was reading were the two keys I needed to unlock my love for reading again.</b
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          Lately it feels like I've been seeing a lot of videos and posts clowning on the TikTok girlies who like to read Romantasy books like ACOTAR,
          and I wanna take a moment to defend them, because I feel like it really fits in with the point I'm trying to make. Just because YOU (the
          weird literature elitist) don't like Romantasy or think the kinds of books these girls are obsessed with are “cringe” doesn't invalidate the
          fact that they are reading and found something that they genuinely enjoy to read. So many of these videos try to belittle these girls and
          say they aren't reading real books, and “oh these books and the people that like them are RUINING the good name of literature” and then turn
          around and try to say “nobody reads anymore.” Yeah, maybe if you stopped gatekeeping what you think is worthy of being called reading, you
          could see that there are tons of people who do in fact enjoy reading. Trying to force people into reading is only going to make them want to
          quit. Why is it so bad to let people enjoy the things they like to read? Maybe they'll eventually want to branch out and get interested in
          the kids of books you deem as “good enough.”
        </p>

        <p>Which leads nicely into the next point I wanted to make:</p>

        <p>
          Another quick thing that I think has contributed to why I've kept reading for so long, if I don't like something, I won't force myself to
          finish reading it. Trying to force yourself to read something and push through it will only reinforce that you “hate” reading because yeah
          of course you would hate reading if you were just forcing yourself to finish stuff you don't like. You're not reading it for a grade for
          English class, you're reading it to have fun, so why keep going if you're not enjoying it? Without some trial and error you wont figure out
          what you like, and hey maybe you'll eventually go back to the books you stopped and try again and find that you actually like it now. I know
          I've done that a few times, especially in the beginning. Sometimes you need to build up your reading stamina before you dive headfirst into
          longer things.
        </p>

        <h3>Why Reading Is Important To Me</h3>

        <p>
          When I was little, reading was just something my friends and I did. We would borrow each others books so we could talk about the stories we
          liked, read on the bus on long field trips, and even enjoy the books that we read during english class, crazy right? It opened up whole new
          worlds and ideas, and gave us another thing to connect to each other with. Reading was part of my personality, part of who I was as a kid.
        </p>

        <p>
          Middle school came around and we were still reading, but slowly I began to transition to reading Creepypastas instead of whole books. It was
          still something fun that I shared with my friends and cousins, but I could tell we were all starting to get busier and put reading on the
          back burner.
        </p>

        <p>
          In high school, I only read a few books for fun because I was so burnt out from the expectation that I read “high level” books, not enjoying
          the books we read in English class, and all of the other work from all of the classes I was taking. Instead of reading, my friends and I
          were watching YouTube and taking Buzzfeed quizzes and doing the school musical and marching band. We “didn't have time” to read anymore.
          College was more of the same, except replace musicals and marching band with clarinet lessons and playing Webkinz in the computer lab.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's interesting to look back on those years and realize just how much I was missing by avoiding reading for so long. At that time I went
          through a lot of struggles, I was depressed, anxious, and going through a lot of medical problems, and I turned to the internet for an
          escape. Turns out, constantly being fed depressing news stories and comparing myself to the well off people on YouTube wasn't quite the
          right way to make myself feel better. I'm not saying that reading instead of going on social media would've fixed my problems, but I do
          think that I could've avoided sinking as low as I got if I had found other creative escapes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Reading provided me a way to escape from the troubles I was having. It let me dive headfirst into a fantasy world where I could forget about
          everything and pretend like magic was real and Bigfoot lived in my backyard (which weirdly was actually cool and not scary to kid me).
          Abandoning books meant looking to other places for escapism, and that only led me to isolating myself on Reddit, Twitter, Instagram, and
          YouTube.
        </p>

        <p>
          Falling in love with reading again opened up so many doors for me. Spending less time doomscrolling on social media gave me an immediate
          improvement to my mental health. But starting to read again didn't make me completely quit social media. I found communities of people
          online who were interested in the things that I was reading, and it reminded me of the days of sharing books with my friends. I could talk
          to people about the newest chapter release or volume of manga, geek out with people about how much we love a certain series, and find
          recommendations for new books from people who were reading the same things I was reading. It was really the first thing that helped me come
          out of my shell again and be comfortable talking to people and trying new things. I would even say that starting to read again is what led
          to me having motivation to find a new job again after months of being depressed during Covid.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's been 4 years since then and I still haven't stopped reading. I wait eagerly for my local bookstore to stock the newest volumes in the
          series I'm reading. I got an e-reader so I can have a book or manga on me at all times. I'll read Webtoons during my down time at work. Now
          I read so much that I record everything I read in a reading journal. I especially need to use it to keep track of all of the manga series
          I'm in the middle of reading so I don't forget what's going on.
        </p>

        <p>
          It took a long time for me to get to this point, to build up my reading stamina and to find the kinds of stories I enjoy reading the most,
          and I’m still not done discovering new things I love. As they say, it's not about the destination, it's about the journey. Reading is
          something that I don't think I will ever stop doing again. But even if I do, I'll just pick up that journey right where I left off.
        </p>

        <p>
          So yes, this whole post is just to say that I am a whole adult and I like to read YA books and light novels and manga meant for 12 year old
          boys and Creepypasta because they're fun and I enjoy reading them. I also like to read things like The Shining and Mistborn and Lord of the
          Rings. It doesn't make me any less of a reader or a person to enjoy the childish things, and if you enjoy those same things, you're not any
          less either. I like to remind myself all the time, don't kill the cringe, kill the part of you that cringes.
