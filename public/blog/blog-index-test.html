      <h3>hey there, welcome to my blog!</h3>
      <p>
        this is the place where i will be posting about my life. anything from my every day life, fun trips, cool experiences, or just things that
        i've been thinking about recently. basically anything that i would normally post on any of my social media i'll post here.

        i'm using
        <a href="https://zonelets.net/" class="link">zonelets</a>
        to build/ code this area of my website, and it has been super helpful to setup a simple blog. i can code js (kinda), but zonelets let me set
        everything up super quick! if you wanna set up a personal blog and either are lazy like me or don't know js, then i highly reccomend using it.
