              Omori is a 2020 psychological horror game created by OMOCAT in which you follow a hikikomori boy named Sunny through the real world and
              his dream world. As you traverse both worlds, you discover things that Sunny kept hidden in his subconsious... things he thought he was
              better off forgetting.

            The way I discovered Omori was the way that I discover a lot of videogames nowadays: the music was reccomended to me! Specifically it was
            the track
            <img src="images/red hand select.gif" class="select" />
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlQd9qWKjLM">World's End Valentine</a> (which goes super hard might I add). I listened to a bunch
            of tracks from the OST at work that day, went home, and immediately told Joe that we have to play Omori right now.
          </p>
          <p>
            I had heard of Omori before listening to the OST, but it was just like 'oh this game is so good you have to play it!', and I just kinda
            brushed it off like yeah I'll get to it eventually. By time I was a good chunk in to the game I was kicking myself for putting off playing
            it for so long.
          </p>
          <p>
            What's funny is that I knew the song
            <img src="images/red hand select.gif" class="select" /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkMLYNWP-yo">My Time by Bo En</a>
            before I even knew about Omori. It had been in my playlists for years and I had no clue it was used in the game until I listened to the
            OST. I remember thinking 'hey wait I know this song????' and looking up to make sure that it wasnt originally from the game and that I
            wasn't going insane hahaha
          </p>

            One of my favorite genre of games is the old RPG Maker style. Ever since I watched let's plays of games like To The Moon and Mad Father in
            middle school/ early high school I was obsessed with the format. There's just something so cool about working within the limitations of
            the style to do creative things and tell an interesting story.
          </p>
          <p>
            (Sidenote: I recently replayed To The Moon with Joe and I can confirm that it still makes me cry like a baby. Also yes I am forcing Joe to
            play all of my old favorite games with me.)
          </p>
          <p>
            I pretty much lost my mind when I saw that OMOCAT actually used RPG Maker to make Omori. Everything in the game was completely custom and
            wasn't using typical RPG Maker default art like I was so used to seeing in those old games, so if I didn't read about it I would've never
            guessed.
          </p>
          <div class="spriteborder">
            <img src="images/KelWalkDW.gif" class="sprite" />
          </div>
          <p>
            There are very few pieces of media in this world that made me feel things the way Omori did. I'm pretty sure that I called in sick to work
            the day after we finished playing it just because I was so emotionally distraught. Even just listening to
            <img src="images/red hand select.gif" class="select" /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ACon4txJiDA">Duet</a>
            will make me tear up and feel things and its been a few years since I've played the game.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I found the Omori live concert on YouTube I was like 'hey this is awesome, I'm gonna give it a listen through!' I remember telling
            Joe "Man, if I was there in real life there's no doubt I would be sobbing by the end." Yeah... I didn't need to be there in person to be
            sobbing by the end. Music always has a way of kicking me right in the emotions every single time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately I have not played the Hikikomori route of the game yet because there have been so many other games I've wanted to play, but
            it is on my list and I will definitely do it. I've gotta emotionally prepare myself for it though lol.
          </p>
          <p>
            Actually, we almost unknowingly did the Hikikomori route first because Joe was so freaked out he didn't want to answer the door for Kel
            because he thought we were gonna get a game over.
          </p>
          <div class="spriteborder">

          </div>
          <p>
            I really wish I could wipe my brain of all memories of this game so I could experience it for the first time again. It's gonna be really
            hard for another piece of media to make me feel the way this game made me feel.
          </p>
          <p>Other media that made me feel things on the same level as Omori:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Steins Gate</li>
            <li>Undertale</li>
            <li>Your Name</li>
            <li>That one episode of Hunter x Hunter</li>
            <li>The Horizon</li>
            <li>Goodnight Punpun</li>
          </ul>
          <p>which may seem like a lot of things but in the grand scheme of the total amount of media I've consumed, that's not very much.</p>
          <div class="spriteborder">
            <img src="images/Dream_Hero_Walk.gif" class="sprite" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Anyway... Omori definitely takes a top spot in my favorite games of all time list. I haven't found another game since playing Omori that
            fills the void in my soul that it left. Manga like The Summer Hikaru Died and I Want to Hug Aono-kun So Badly I Could Die almost seem to
            hit the same vibe, but don't have the same emotional impact on me that the end of Omori did.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course I have collected a few pieces of merch since playing too: a couple pins and the 'My thoughts will follow you into your dreams'
            Basil t-shirt (which I often wear to work even though maybe I shouldn't). You know I love a piece of media when I actually go out of my
            way to get merch from it.
          </p>
          <p>
            I didn't really wanna spoil much on this page because I think that everyone should play the game and go in as blind as possible. I wasn't
            spoiled going into it and I'm so glad I avoided spoilers the whole time (somehow I am a spoiler magnet, they find me even when I'm not
            looking for them).
