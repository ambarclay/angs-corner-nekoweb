          One of the things I love to do is to go on Picrew and make tons of fun characters, some based on ideas I already had and some that just come
          to me in the moment. Sometimes I like those characters enough that they get their own backstory, and sometimes those characters actually get
          a whole story written using them.

          <h2>Bloodheist</h2>
          <div class="description">
            <p>
              "This story isn't about vampires. It's just a normal slice of life about a normal boy and his normal friends. Nothing strange going on
              in this book, I promise."
            </p>
            <p>
              This is a story that Joe and I are writing about a boy named Connor who figures out that he's a vampire and subsequently joins a group
              of vampires and steals blood from his job at the blood donation charity. Bloodheist has become our baby over the past couple years. We
              haven't made too much progress on writing because of how busy the both of us are, but all the ideas we come up with (I think) are pretty
              solid. Evil corporation, cute main romance, relateable mc, weirdo best friends... ok well maybe this story is tailored to my own
              interests.

          <h2>Grayscale and Color</h2>
          <div class="description">
            <p>
              "Two worlds exist: one in grayscale and one in color. Most people in either world don't know that the other one exists, except for a
              select few. Citizens of each world are prevented from traveling to the other. Somehow, a child from the grayscale world ends up on the
              steps of an orphanage. Not knowing what to do, they are taken in, adopted by a nice family, and raised in the color world. One day, on
              the child's 13th birthday, they disappear, leaving behind only a note to their best friend, telling him about the greyscale world and
              how to find them."
            </p>
            <p>
              So this story idea is one that I came up with all the way back in middle school. I had written a couple of chapters of it on my first
              computer, and reading it back as an adult I was like 'hey this is actually a pretty cool idea'. I spent some time workshopping the story
              and characters and something cool started to take shape. I still have a lot of work to make it a full fledged story, but the characters
              I created hold a special place in my heart and will probably forever be some of my favorite OCs.
            </p>
            <p>And yes, every character is named after a color. Pretty cringe but I thought it was cool at the time okay?</p>

              "Altair is a witch. Not just any witch, he is the heir to one of the high mage families; the Blackthornes. Known for their scribe magic,
              they can use their pen and paper to make almost any spell you can think of. Altair has been learning his family's magic ever since he
              was a child with rigorous classes for as long as he can remember. One day during his training, a major summoning spell goes awry, and it
              was the last straw for both Altair and his family. The usually timid Altair grabs his journal, leaves the family mansion, and runs into
              the dark forest. The next thing he remembers, he is laying on the street in an unfamiliar town with an unfamiliar girl by his side."
            </p>
            <p>
              Ah yes, this is one of those story ideas that came to me after I created the character in Picrew. I made Altair (the mc) and thought
              'hey he looks pretty cool, I wonder what I could do this this...' and I started to come up with things like why his eyes were different
              colors and why he looked so afraid.
            </p>
            <p>
              I don't have much written for this story besides some idea brainstorming, so hopefully one day I'll get around to writing more of it.

              "The first moments of consciousness I had after waking up were disorienting, but not unpleasant. Before I had a chance to open my eyes I
              could hear the gentle rustling of leaves, I could feel the grass beneath me, soft and sweet smelling. Feeling the warmth of the sun on
              my face reminded me of that morning's walk in the park, bringing the events that had just occurred to the front of my mind. When I
              finally opened my eyes, I saw the clear blue sky that seemed to stretch into infinity above me, behind me were tall trees at the edges
              of my vision swaying gently in the breeze. In front of me was an open field with buildings in the distance dotting the horizon.

              a brief moment, a memory of the nightmares that plagued me for so long surfaced.

              This is a story of Kenta and Maro, a man and his dog who get isekai'd into a fantasy world. Kenta believes that it's finally his chance
