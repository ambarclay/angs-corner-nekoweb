        <h2>(天官赐福, Tiān Guān Cì Fú, TGCF)</h2>
        <div class="description">
          <p>
            Born the crown prince of a prosperous kingdom, Xie Lian was renowned for his beauty,
            strength, and purity. His years of dedication and noble deeds allowed him to ascend to
            godhood. But those who rise, can also fall... and fall he does, cast from the Heavens
            again and again and banished to the mortal realm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eight hundred years after his mortal life, Xie Lian has ascended to godhood for the
            third time. Now only a lowly scrap collector, he is dispatched to wander the earthly
            realm to take on tasks appointed by the heavens to pay back debts and maintain his
            divinity. Aided by old friends and foes alike, and graced with the company of a
            mysterious young man with whom he feels an instant connection, Xie Lian must confront
            the horrors of his past in order to dispel the curse of his present.

          Known by many names, Heaven Official's Blessing is the series that got me into the danmei
          genre. Many would be quick to write it off just because of the genre, but it is so much
          more than what you might expect. Over the course of 8 books, you are taken on a journey
          that spans 800 years, one that shows that undying love and hatred can withstand many
          lifetimes.

        <p>
          The author of TGCF (Mo Xiang Tong Xiu, or MXTX as many in the fandom call her) has written
          two other series:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Scum Villian's Self-Saving System (人渣反派自救系統, Rén Zhā Fǎnpài Zìjiù Xìtǒng,
            SVSSS)
            <ul style="list-style-type: '→ '">
              <li>
                MC Shen Yuan ends up getting isekai'd into the web novel he just finished as the
                villian who dies a horrible death, and somehow ends up romancing the male lead Luo
                Binghe.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation (魔道祖师, Mó Dào Zǔ Shī, MDZS)
            <ul style="list-style-type: '→ '">
              <li>
                Two parallel tales recounting the events of Wei Wuxian's past and present lives, the
                investigation of the mystery behind a fierce dismembered entity presently
                terrorizing the cultivation world, and the development of the novel's central love
                story between Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji, his former classmate and fellow cultivator.

                  >source</a
                >
              </li>
              <li>
                This is another one of my favorite danmei series and I will probably eventually make
                a shrine for that too.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For me though, TGCF is the one that left the biggest impact. I don't think there are words
          to describe the way the romance in this book makes me feel, not to mention the emotional
          rollercoaster that is the story the series tells. One chapter you will be hanging out with
          Xie Lian and Hua Cheng (our two main characters) while they garden or tidy up the shrine,
          and the next chapter they will be investigating a mysterious death that you figure out
          somehow connects back to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that all that formal explain-y stuff is done, it's time to fangirl. Just a heads up,
          there will be spoilers on this page, so if you are at all interested I reccomend you go
          read the books instead of looking at all my fangirl yapping!

        <h1>xie lian</h1>
        <div class="character-description">
          <p>
            Where do I even begin to explain how much I love Xie Lian as a protagonist. He is one
            of, if not the strongest character in the whole series, but based on his outwars
            presentation as a pacifist you would never guess. A lot of people tend to think Xie Lian
            isn't powerful or someone who always needs help and saving, but that isn't true at all!
            Even though he has his powers/ spiritual energy sealed away for most of the series, he
            still kicks everyones butt. But thats what I love so much about his character! Even
            though he is a pacifict and would rather solve things non-violently, it doesn't mean
            that he isn't perfectly able to fight if he needs to. <br />
            <br />
            Once you get to read about Xie Lians past in the story, you will come to realize that he
            wasn't always a pacifist, hell he almost infected an entire village with a horrible
            disease and pretty much killed a whole royal family of a city (granted it was to stop a
            massacre but still). Another reason why I love his character so much - you get to see
            exactly what he went through to make him behave in the way that he does throughout the
            story. You see exactly why he is a pacifist now and why he thinks he needs to put
            himself through trials like sealing away his spiritual energy and luck and investigating
            suspicious things for Jun Wu. <br />
            <br />
            AND HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH HUA CHENG??? Bro was really using "exchanging spiritual
            energy" as an excuse to make out with Hua Cheng ahahaha. No my dude, you're just in
            love. Xie Lian's cultivation style demands abstaining from things like alcohol and sex,
            so he was really just trying to make up excuses.
          </p>
          <img src="images/xie-lian.webp" class="xielianimg" />
        </div>
        <p>
          I love how immediately Xie Lian felt a connection with Hua Cheng, and his caring side
          really shows when he offered Hua Cheng to stay with him at his shrine despite not having a
          lot to offer. See, another reason to love Xie Lian, he will sacrifice anything to help
          people. But Hua Cheng never takes advantage of Xie Lian and is always there to help him in
          any situation, and would (and did) kill anyone who would try to take advantage of or
          badmouth him.
        </p>
        <p>
          My favorite part of the whole series are the Xie Lian backstory chapters. MXTX does such a
          good job of developing his character, the scenes right after Xie Lian was kicked out of
          heaven the first time are some of the most heart wrenching things I've ever read. Seeing
          Xie Lian and his family poor and destitute, his kingdom destroyed, his friends abandoning
          him, and being tormented by White No Face- aaaaahhh it makes me sad just thinking about
          it. At least he had Wu Ming ♥

        <div class="character-description">
          <img src="images/hua-cheng.webp" class="huachengimg" />
          <p>
            Hua Cheng is the man everyone wishes that they had. Hua Cheng is the man that would
            treat you right. Hua Cheng would kill 33 heavenly officials just because they badmouthed
            you. If my man ain't as devoted as Hua Cheng is to Xie Lian, I don't want him. My poor
            guy had an unrequited crush for 800 years and some how stuck it out through sheer force
            of will. Heck, he came back as the strongest, most powerful ghost because his love for
            Xie Lian was just THAT strong. The only other MC I can think of who had a crush for
            longer is Shen Wei from Guardian, but TGCF is way better than Guardian imo. <br />
            <br />
            I just think it's funny how Hua Cheng thought he was so slick meeting Xie Lian in the
            beginning and asking him to call him San Lang ("lang" being a term of endearment like
            "dear"). He really met his idol and was like "actually can you please call me sweetie."
            AND XIE LIAN DOES. We love that for them. <br />
            <br />
            And then how Xie Lian goes back and tells all the hevenly officials that his new bestie
            is some ghost called Hua Cheng and everyone is like NO STAY AWAY FROM HIM and Xie Lian
            is just like "idk I think he's really nice." <br />
            <br />
            Bro is ready to fight god to defend his boyfriend and I just think thats really neat.
            <br />
            <br />
            I just... thinking about the fact the Hua Cheng was searching for Xie Lian for that 800
            years but could never find him? I'm crying. Also Hua Cheng experiencing some of Xie
            Lian's worst moments and still deciding to be by his side?
          </p>
        </div>
        <p style="margin-top: 0">
          I mean, Hua Cheng was ready to destroy a whole city with Xie Lian just because Xie Lian
          asked him to, and when Xie Lian regretted his decision to unleash the disease Hua Cheng
          took it all upon himself and pretty much killed himself just to spare Xie Lian the guilt
          of massacring an entire city. Talk about devotion.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the last part of the series, when Xie Lian is fighting Jun Wu and Hua Cheng gives
          literally all of his spiritual power to free Xie Lian from his cursed shackles so he can
          fight at full power... man I was crying the whole time. I remember seeing the illustration
          of Hua Cheng's spirit dispersing and being like "well that's it, I have depression and I
          don't wanna read anymore." But MAN am I glad I kept reading because the ending (and extra
          chapters) were so so worth it. I really took my time reading all of the extras because I
          really didn't want the series to be over.

        <h1>general fangirling</h1>
        <p>
          My first encounter with the series was through the donghua (anime). I had just finished
          watching the Sk8 the Infinity dub (yes I am a dub enjoyer), and I saw Howard Wang (Langa's
          VA) post on Twitter about another show he was in called Heaven Official's Blessing. It
          looked pretty cool so I put it on myanimelist to check out when I needed a new show to
          watch.
        </p>
        <p>
          A long time passed and I was looking for a show to watch and Crunchyroll reccomended
          Heaven Official's Blessing to me. I remembered seeing the post on Twitter about it so I
          decided to give it a shot and uh... yeah I actually didn't pay attention to the first
          episode whatsoever and I was so confused and thought the show just wasn't for me, oof. I'm
          pretty good about giving things a few chances before giving up on them, so later that week
          I sat down and really paid attention to the show and the rest is history. I binged season
          1 of the donghua, learned that season 2 kept getting delayed, so pretty much immediately
          ran to Barnes and Noble to pick up the first couple volumes.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I say I read everything at lighning speed, I mean it took me 1-2 days to finish a
          whole volume. The sad thing was was that when I started reading it I needed to wait for
          the last few volumes to release, so I couldn't just binge it all at once. I think needing
          to wait really encouraged my obsession with TGCF to grow hahaha.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, when season 2 of the donghua came out, I made Joe rewatch season 1 with me so we
          could watch season 2 together, and he actually really enjoyed it! So much so that I
          convinced him to do a book swap with me: I read his favorite series (Mistborn) if he reads
          mine (TGCF of course). He just finished reading book 4 as of me writing this and I've
          already read every Mistborn book (the original series and Wax and Wayne and Secret History
          lol).
        </p>
        <p>
          There's this part in season 2 of the donghua with Wind Master and Feng Xin where Wind
          Master is in girl mode and touches Feng Xin, and cause Feng Xin is scared of women he just
          goes "KEEP THOSE THINGS AWAY FROM ME! JUST SWITCH BACK RIGHT NOW!" Idk why, but we thought
          that was the funniest thing we ever head and we quote that shit all of the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          While we're talking about the dongua, can I mention that James Cheek does an immaculate
          job voicing Hua Cheng? Like, he has put every ounce of effort into that voice and it
          shows. Powerful, flirty, simp-y, it's everything Hua Cheng is. And Howard Wang as Xie
          Lian? He does a great job of playing the gentle pacifict, and I'm really excited to see
          him voice if/ when the backstory parts are animated? Reagan Murdock as Jun Wu, Jacob
          Eiseman as Shi Qingxuan, Jordan Dash Cruz as Qi Rong???? Literally an immaculate voice
          cast. Even if you're not a dub watcher you really should give the TGCF dub a try because
          it is so so so good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's talk about shipping real quick. I'm a person who absolutely does not care who you
          ship, but I do have my opinions of those ships haha. Feng Xin x Mu Qing? Heck yeah,
          enemies to loves I agree. But Xie Lian x Jun Wu? No way, get real, the only acceptable Xie
          Lian ship in my eyes is Xie Lian and Hua Cheng. Dudes were literally made for each other
          and you want Xie Lian to be with Mr. holds a grudge for 1000 years? Nah nope I don't like
          it. But you do you, it's not too serious and it's just fiction so I'm not pressed about
          it.
